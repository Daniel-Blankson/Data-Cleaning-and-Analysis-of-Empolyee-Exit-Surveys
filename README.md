# Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-of-Empolyee-Exit-Surveys
This project was designed to practice and demonstrate data cleaning and analyses skills. The task is to use dataframes of the exit surveys from the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and Technical and Further Education (TAFE), to answer the following questions:  
* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?  
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
